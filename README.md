# PyRadar
CINRAD basic data read.

read all of  basic data in CINRAD. Up to now, this module has only been checked by the basic data of SA data. All kinds of attributes and methods can help you get data in the original .bin document and draw the PPI images. About attributes and methods please read the RadarExample.py document.

Before you using from PyRadar import Radar, please make new direction c:/data/img/ to save drawed picture.
Two arguments are need when you initialize class Radar: one is .bin file's path, the other is full file name.

If you find some errors while using it, I'm very glad to get your advice to help me improve it so that more poeple can use it easily.
